## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on successful and failed campaigns in US and GB to uncover trends that share best times and places to gain fundings for future campaigns 
### Recommendations Going Forward
- With the information uncovered with the given data, the most successful campaigns launch in the United States were the theatre campaigns. From those, the ones that had the most success in reaching their monetary goals were those launched in the month of May. 
- In Great Britian, plays had the most sucessful category to launch. However, the budget that was funded averaged around $4000. 
- I would recommend beginning your campaign funding in plays as it tends to be the most successfull in launching. May seems to be when campaigns were most successfull in gaining capital for plays and theatres. Additionally, if you continue to start your campaign in US, you will have a higher chance in reaching your budget goals here versus in GB.
